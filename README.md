# Academic Projects Repository

Welcome to my academic projects repository! Here you will find a collection of projects that I developed during my time at university. Each directory contains a specific project, and this README provides an overview of the content.

## How to Use

Each project directory has its own set of instructions and specific information. Refer to the README within each directory for details on how to set up, run, or contribute to the project.


I hope you find these projects interesting and useful!
